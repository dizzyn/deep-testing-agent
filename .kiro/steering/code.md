# Code Style Guidelines

## TypeScript Standards

- **Use only strict TypeScript configuration without `any` types**
- **Never use .js extensions for typescript files**
- Prefer explicit type annotations for function parameters and return values
- Use type unions and intersections over interfaces for function responses

## Architecture Patterns

- Favor functional composition over object-oriented programming
- Write pure functions when possible
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- Use function composition to build complex behavior from simple parts

## Code Quality

- Write minimalistic, human-readable code
- Prioritize clarity and simplicity over cleverness
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions and over-engineering

## Testing Policy

- Do not write automated tests unless explicitly requested
- Focus on writing self-documenting, reliable code instead
