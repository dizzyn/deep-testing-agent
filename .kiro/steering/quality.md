# Product Quality

## Build Real, Working Systems

- We pivot from scratch to the real application
- Increment the codebase by meaningful pieces
- Build working/presentable pieces in short iterations
- If the UI is testable on UI ask user to test
- Keep the system working end-to-end
- **Don't mock any functionality without permission to pretend working system**
